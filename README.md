**Note that you cannot commit directly to master or dev!**

- The master branch is the stable branch of this project. It may only be updated via pull request from student developer, with the Tech Lead's approval.
- The dev branch is the main working branch. It may only be updated by pull request from uncontrolled branches.

For regular development, each developer must create a "feature branch" this is a branch named in the convention: "feature/name" or "bugfix/name". These are for new features and for bugfixes, respectively. For example: "armsorting/claire" or "camera-test/laksh"

When work starts on a new feature, its branch will be made off of the latest version of dev, and all development will occur on the branch. When the feature is considered ready, it will be merged onto the dev branch. When merging, automatic merging, LV Merge tool merging, or simply copying and pasting of code fragments may be necessary.
